<h2>Local Development</h2>

Please ensure that your local server meets the first 3 server requirements in order to achieve the best possible development results when building your custom add-ons, modules, and mods.</p>

<h2>Installation and Upgrade</h2>

<p>While PHP-Nuke Titanium uses the same core as PHP-Nuke Evolution Xtreme there have been a lot of updates to it which improve performance and security, please see the following links for installing a fresh copy or upgrading.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>

<p>Security is the top priority for this CMS, the core of PHP-Nuke Titanium uses a comprehensive integrated module called Nuke Sentinel (tm). Nuke Sentinel (tm) protects your website against DDOS, CLIKE, Union, and many more attacks, Nuke Sentinel (tm) is so advanced you don&#39;t even have to worry about protecting your admin panel as it watches for failed logins and can ban anonymous users automatically from your website.</p>

<p>Hopefully, you will never have to visit the admin panel for Nuke Sentinel (tm) as 99% of all web hosts now have DDOS protection and many more security features which prevent attacks and such.</p>
